Suppose you have a stack $S$ containing $n$ elements and a queue $Q$ that is
initially empty. Describe how you can use $Q$ to scan $S$ to see if it contains a
certain element $x$, with the additional constraint that your algorithm must
return the elements back to $S$ in their original order. You may only use $S$,
$Q$, and a constant number of other variables.
