Since the arithmetic progression starts at 0, term number <img src="/solutions/exercises/R/ch2/ex19/tex/c1e46120d7213a261e8bb7d29ebab400.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=50.45661224999999pt height=26.76175259999998pt/>
will be equal to <img src="/solutions/exercises/R/ch2/ex19/tex/fabdcab467ab8c49804dceb4a6785172.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=21.324302999999993pt height=26.76175259999998pt/>.  The included program can demonstrate this
empirically by iterating the progression, but such a large number of
iterations will not run in a reasonable amount of time on consumer
hardware.  Therefore, it is recommended to explore the pattern with
smaller powers of 2.
