Consider a variant of Exercise C-5.16, in which an array of capacity $N$, is
resized to capacity precisely that of the number of elements, any time the
number of elements in the array goes strictly below $\frac{N}{2}$. Show that there
exists a sequence of $n$ operations that requires $Î©(n^2)$ time to execute.
