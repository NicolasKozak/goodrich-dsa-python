Exercise R-2.12 uses the \_\_mul\_\_ method to support multiplying a
Vector by a number, while Exercise R-2.14 uses the mul method to support
computing a dot product of two vectors. Give a single implementation of
Vector.\_\_mul\_\_ that uses run-time type checking to support both
syntaxes u * v and u * k, where u and v designate vector instances and
k represents a number.
