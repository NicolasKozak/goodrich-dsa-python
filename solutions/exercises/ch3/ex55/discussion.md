Getting a good plot of all three algorithms at once is maddening. At values of $n$ where the quadratic
algorithms run in a reasonable time, the linear algorithm is so fast that the use of system resources
by other processes is a large percentage influence to its runtime.

Ideally, we'd have a graph where the runtimes of the quadratic algorithms have the same slope but
different y-intercepts while the runtime of linear algorithm has a slope whose value is half of that
for the quadratic algorithms.
