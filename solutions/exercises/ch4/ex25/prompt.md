Provide a nonrecursive implementation of the draw interval function for
the English ruler project of Section 4.1.2. There should be precisely $2^{c}−1$
lines of output if c represents the length of the center tick. If incrementing
a counter from 0 to $2^{c}−2$, the number of dashes for each tick line should
be exactly one more than the number of consecutive 1’s at the end of the
binary representation of the counter.
