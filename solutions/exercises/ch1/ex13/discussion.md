The prompt specifically asks for how pseudocode differs from the Python
function but the book, at least at this point, does not present a
formal framework for constructing pseudocode. In its most general
sense, pseudocode is simply a prototype that has not been explictly
validated for compilability. It is typically used to communicate and
plan at a more detailed level than UML but before actual software
construction has begun.

Therefore, pseudocode can have many styles and is highly team
specific. We could, for instance, use Python-like code that isn't
rigorous regarding syntax.

In conclusion, the prompt is not detailed enough to constitute a fully
formed query.  My best effort to respond is to submit two Python
scripts that implement two different algorithms for reversing a
sequence of integers.  One is non destructive in that it creates a new
sequence.  The other is destructive in that it modifies the original
sequence.
