Python allows negative integers to be used as indices into a sequence,
such as a string. If string s has length _n_, and expression s[k] is
used for index <img src="/solutions/exercises/R/ch1/ex8/tex/4c248251c413973b5dbd7861e15de0be.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=84.6738882pt height=22.831056599999986pt/>, what is the equivalent
index <img src="/solutions/exercises/R/ch1/ex8/tex/d64988549f253b110864584b08402cf9.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=37.55610374999999pt height=21.5460564pt/> such that s[j] references the same element?
