Implement a class, SubstitutionCipher, with a constructor that takes a
string with the 26 uppercase letters in an arbitrary order and uses that for
the forward mapping for encryption (akin to the self. forward string in
our CaesarCipher class of Code Fragment 5.11). You should derive the
backward mapping from the forward version.
