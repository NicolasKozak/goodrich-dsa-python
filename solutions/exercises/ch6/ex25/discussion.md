\_\_len\_\_ and is_empty run in $O(1)$ time since the \_\_len\_\_ and is_empty of ArrayStack run in O(1) time.

enqueue runs in amortized $0(1)$ time since the push method of ArrayStack runs in amortized O(1) time

Each enqueued item is only transferred to the dequeue stack once. The pop method
of ArrayStack runs in amortized $O(1)$ time and the top method of ArrayStack runs in $0(1)$ time. Therefore,
first runs in amortized $O(1)$ time.

Each enqueued item is only transferred to the dequeue stack once. The pop method of ArrayStack runs in amortized $O(1)$
time. Therefore, dequeue runs in amortized $O(1)$ time.
