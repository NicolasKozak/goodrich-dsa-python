Write a short program that takes as input three integers,
a, b, and c, from the console and determines if they can be
used in a correct arithmetic formula (in the given order), like
$``\mathit{a} + \mathit{b} = \mathit{c}"$,
$``\mathit{a} = \mathit{b} - \mathit{c}"$,
or $``\mathit{a} * \mathit{b} = \mathit{c}"$.
