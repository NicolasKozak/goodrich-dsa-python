$128 * 2^{56} = 2^7 * 2^{56} = 2^{63}$

Since the arithmetic progression starts at 0, term number $2^{56} + 1$
will be equal to $2^{63}$.  The included program can demonstrate this
empirically by iterating the progression, but such a large number of
iterations will not run in a reasonable amount of time on consumer
hardware.  Therefore, it is recommended to explore the pattern with
smaller powers of 2.
