The justification is the same as before except now we need to amortize $3k$ cyber-dollars over the $\frac{k}{2}$ append
operations since the last doubling of the array size. Therefore, we must save 6 cyber-dollars per append operation
($6 \frac{k}{2} = 3k$). Since each append operation costs 1 cyber-dollar, we must charge a total of 7 cyber dollars
per append operation.
